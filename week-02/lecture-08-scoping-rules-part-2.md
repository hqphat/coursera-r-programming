Scoping Rules - Part 2
======================

Why does it matter?

* Typically a function is defined in the global environment so that the values of free variables are found in the user's workspace
* This behavior is logical for most people and is usually the "right thing" to do
* However, in R you can have functions defined inside other functions
	* Languages live C don't let you do this
* Now things get interesting -- In this case the environment in which a function is defined is the body of another function!

Example:

	make.power <- function(n) {
		pow <- function(x) {
			x^n
		}
		
		pow
	}

This function returns another function as its value

	> cube <- make.power(3)
	> square <- make.power(2)
	> cube(3)
	[1] 27
	> square(3)
	[1] 9


Exploring a Function Closure
----------------------------

What's in a function's environment?

	> ls(environment(cube))
	[1] "n" "pow"
	> get("n", environment(cube))
	[1] "3"
	
	> ls(environment(square))
	[1] "n" "pow"
	> get("n", environment(square))
	[1] 2


Lexical vs. Dynamic Scoping
---------------------------

What is the value of f(3)?

	y <- 10
	
	f <- function(x) {
		y <- 2
		y^2 + g(x)
	}
	
	g <- function(x) {
		x*y
	}
	
	> f(3)
	[1] 34

* With lexical scoping the value of y in the function g is looked up in the environment in which the function was defined, in this case the global environment, so the value of y is 10.
* With dynamic scoping, the value of y is looked up in the environment from which the function is called (sometimes referred to as the calling environment.
	* In R the calling environment is known as the parent frame
* so the value of y would be 2

When a function is defined in the global environment and is subsequently called from the global environment, then the defining environment and the calling environment are the same. This can sometimes give the appearance of dynamic scoping.

	> g<- function(x) {
	+ 	a <- 3
	+ 	x + a + y
	+ }
	> g(2)
	Error in g(2) : object "y" not found
	> y <-3
	> g(2)
	[1] 8


Other languages
---------------

Other languages that support lexical scoping:

* Scheme
* Perl
* Python
* Common Lisp (all languages converge to Lisp)


Consequences of Lexical  Scoping
--------------------------------

* In R all objects must be stored in memory
* All functions must carry a pointer to their respective defining environments, which could be anywhere
* In S-PLUS, free variables are always looked up in the global workspace, so everything can be stored on the disk because the "defining environment" of all the functions was the same
